# .github/workflows/ — CI Pipeline

## Purpose

GitHub Actions workflows implementing the 4-stage CI pipeline and
post-failure reporting.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ci.yml` | Main pipeline: lint → contract-preflight → p2996-prep → build → smoke-test (PR/schedule) OR lint → promote (push to main) |
| `ci-failure-report.yml` | Post-failure diagnostics / issue filing |

## Pipeline stages

PR / schedule / workflow_dispatch path:

1. **lint** — mise install, hk pre-commit, agnix agent-doc validation
   (`agnix --target claude-code --strict .`), `mise doctor --json`
   health check, `mise.lock` artifact upload, mise data cache keyed on
   `mise.lock`.
2. **contract-preflight** — Python 3.14 + uv; runs `dotfiles-setup
   verify run` over `python/verification/suites.toml`.
3. **base-prep** — computes content-hash of base inputs via
   `dotfiles-setup base-hash`. Probes
   `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:base-<hash16>` with `docker manifest
   inspect`. On hit, exits in <30s. On miss, builds the `base` bake
   target (devcontainer-base stage = apt + mise install + cargo) and
   pushes it. p2996-prep and build both pull this image so neither
   rebuilds the heavy mise install when only p2996 inputs change.
4. **p2996-prep** — computes content-hash of P2996 inputs via
   `dotfiles-setup p2996-hash`. Probes
   `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:p2996-<hash16>` with `docker manifest
   inspect`. On hit, exits in <30s. On miss, builds the `p2996-cache`
   bake target (the scratch-based `p2996-export` stage holding just
   `/opt/clang-p2996`, ~500 MB) and pushes it to GHCR.
5. **build** — `docker buildx bake dev` with
   `dev.args.P2996_SOURCE=<cache_ref>` from p2996-prep. On cache hit
   the Dockerfile's `clang-builder` stage is `FROM <cache_ref>` instead
   of `FROM p2996-export`, skipping the multi-hour clang compile (see
   `.devcontainer/P2996-CACHE.md` for the current baseline).
   Always pushes (`:pr-NNN` or `:sha-<sha>` for PRs; `:dev`/`:latest`
   for schedule and `force_dev_tag=true` workflow_dispatch).
6. **smoke-test** — pulls `:sha-<github.sha>` (the freshly-built
   image) and runs the same checks against PR images that previously
   only ran on main builds. The image smoked on the PR is the exact
   image that gets retagged as `:dev`/`:latest` on merge.

Push-to-main path (after a PR merge):

1. **lint** — same as PR path, validates the merge commit's tree.
2. **promote** — looks up the merged PR via `gh api graphql
   associatedPullRequests`. On hit, runs `docker buildx imagetools
   create -t :dev -t :latest <:pr-NNN>` — a manifest-only retag,
   ~30 sec, no rebuild. On miss (direct push, force-push), dispatches
   `ci.yml` with `force_dev_tag=true` to fall back to a full build.

## Invariants

- **All actions SHA-pinned** via pinact. Run `mise run pin-actions`
  locally to verify before committing workflow changes.
- **Python 3.14** for contract-preflight and smoke-test jobs
  (`actions/setup-python@v6`, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v8`).
- **lint job** caches mise data directory keyed on `mise.lock`.
- **build job** passes GitHub token via BuildKit **secret mount**
  (`uid=1000` for vscode user) — never via `ARG` or env.
- **`CONTAINER_REGISTRY`** env var, not `REGISTRY` (avoids HCL
  collision with the `REGISTRY` target in `docker-bake.hcl`).
- **PR builds push** — every PR build pushes `:pr-NNN` and
  `:sha-<github.sha>` to GHCR so smoke-test can validate the exact
  image that promote will retag on merge. There is no
  `cacheonly` mode anymore. (Earlier sessions referenced
  `feedback_docker_ci_workarounds` for the previous `cacheonly`
  conditional — that posture was deliberately removed in the cache+
  promote rework.)
- **Push-to-main does NOT rebuild.** `build`, `p2996-prep`, and
  `smoke-test` are all gated `if: github.event_name != 'push' ||
  github.ref != 'refs/heads/main'`. The merge commit is published
  via `promote`'s manifest-retag of the PR's `:pr-NNN`.
- **P2996 cache invalidation.** The cache key is computed from
  `CLANG_P2996_REF`, `BASE_IMAGE`, `PLATFORM`, the Dockerfile, the
  bake file, and `.devcontainer/mise-system-resolved.json`. Refresh
  the resolved-snapshot via `mise run capture-mise-system-resolved`
  inside the devcontainer when conda-forge drift on `"latest"` should
  bust the cache.
- **`uv run --project python`**, not `--directory` — `--directory`
  changes cwd and breaks relative test paths.
- **Use `--watch` flags for waiting**, never hand-roll poll loops.
  Canonical: `gh pr checks <n> --watch [--fail-fast] [--interval 30]`.
  See `.claude/rules/gh-cli-watch.md` and the
  `feedback_gh_cli_watch_flag` auto-memory.
- **`gh run watch --exit-status` is unreliable** — verify workflow
  completion with `gh pr checks <n> --json` or
  `gh run view <id> --json conclusion`.
- **No `type=gha` cache on `base` / `p2996-cache` bake targets.**
  Registry tag + `Probe cache` (`docker manifest inspect`) IS the
  durable cache. `mode=max` gha export of these heavy layers exceeds
  the 1-hour Azure SAS token TTL on cold runs and fails with
  `403 AuthenticationFailed` after wasting ~1h of the runner. Documented
  in `docker-bake.hcl`. The `dev` target keeps gha cache (small overlay,
  no probe gate, well under 1-hour SAS limit).
- **Trivy is `scanners: vuln` + `timeout: 15m`.** Default scanners
  (`vuln,secret,misconfig`) timeout at 5min exporting our multi-GB
  image through the Docker socket. Scope is intentionally CVE-only
  (warn-only mode, see issue #92); secret + misconfig are out of
  scope here.
- **`wagoodman/dive` action is broken upstream.** v0.13.1's
  auto-built Dockerfile has `ARG DOCKER_CLI_VERSION=${DOCKER_CLI_VERSION}`
  with no default, fetches `docker-.tgz` and 404s. Use the binary
  release tarball directly in a `run:` step; do NOT switch back to
  `uses: wagoodman/dive@<sha>`.

## Cron schedules (`schedule:`)

- **GHA `schedule.cron` supports a sibling `timezone:` field.** Use
  `cron: "0 0 * * *"` + `timezone: "America/Chicago"` for IANA-zoned
  schedules. Verified against the GHA workflow-syntax docs 2026-04-27.
  Older AI-summarized claims of "GHA cron is UTC-only" are stale —
  the field is supported.

## Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

- **`interval: "cron"` enforces a 24h minimum.** The schema accepts
  `interval: "cron"` + `cronjob: "<expr>"` + `timezone: "<tz>"`, but
  `dependabot-api.githubapp.com` rejects sub-daily expressions:
  *"Cronjob expression has a minimum interval of 1 hours which is less
  than the minimum allowed interval of 24 hours."* Use `0 0 * * *`
  (daily at midnight) or longer; do NOT try `0 * * * *` (hourly). The
  validation runs as a check named `.github/dependabot.yml` on every
  PR that touches the file. (PR #86 commit `b5022c0`.)

## Debugging CI failures

- Check the build job diagnostics step first (`docker buildx bake
  --print`) — it often shows known warnings without needing the full
  build log.
- `mise doctor --json` output in the lint job shows tool resolution
  issues.
- **App-installed check error detail** (dependabot, CodeRabbit, etc.)
  lives in the check-runs API, not in `gh pr checks` output. Use:
  `gh api 'repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/BRANCH/check-runs' --jq
  '.check_runs[] | select(.name | contains("NAME")) |
  .output.summary'` (substitute uppercase placeholders) to surface the
  actual rejection message.
- For Docker warning triage, see the `ci-warning-investigator` skill
  under `.claude/skills/`.
- Use `gh run watch <id> --exit-status` (or `gh pr checks <n> --watch`)
  to monitor workflows — **never sleep-poll**. See
  `feedback_gh_run_watch`. But always cross-verify with
  `gh pr checks <n> --json` because `--exit-status` has reported exit 0
  before runs were actually complete.
- **`gh run list` returns multiple workflows.** A branch with both
  `ci.yml` and `autofix.yml` has a `CI` run AND an `autofix.ci` run
  per push; `gh run list --limit 1` may surface the wrong one. Filter
  with `--workflow CI` (or `--workflow autofix.ci`) to disambiguate.
- **Manual autofix-fix recipe** — if `autofix-ci/action` can't push
  back (e.g. app uninstalled, `500 autofix.ci app is not installed`),
  the diff is in the run's `autofix.ci.zip` artifact (substitute
  uppercase RUN_ID and FILE placeholders):
  ```bash
  gh run download RUN_ID -D /tmp/autofix
  jq -r '.changes.additions[] | select(.path=="FILE") | .contents' \
    /tmp/autofix/autofix.ci/autofix.json | base64 -d > /tmp/FILE
  cp /tmp/FILE FILE
  ```
  Apply locally, commit, push. Validated on PR #94 commit `cb186ac`
  (mise.lock linux-x64 blake3 checksum drift).
- **Re-run a failed job to verify a fix** — `gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed`
  refires only the failed jobs against the same commit. Useful for
  verifying that a config change (e.g. installing a GitHub app)
  actually fixes the failure mode without forcing a fresh push. Used
  to verify the autofix.ci app install in session 2026-05-01 (run
  `25201532504` failed on first run, succeeded on rerun against the
  same commit `ee079c5`).
